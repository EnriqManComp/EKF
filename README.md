Extended Kalman Filter

The Linear Kalman filter is a powerful tool, but many systems encountered in practice are nonlinear.
One approach to state estimation for nonlinear systems is to linearize the equations about the current
estimate and then apply Kalman's equations using the resulting approximation. This formulation is called
the extended Kalman filtering.

In summary can we implement EKF using the following equations:
